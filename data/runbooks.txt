=== SSH Failed Login Attempts ===
Multiple "Failed password for invalid user" entries indicate a possible brute-force attack.
If repeated attempts originate from the same IP address, investigate immediately.

Recommended actions:
- block suspicious IP addresses
- enable fail2ban or intrusion prevention
- enforce key-based authentication
- disable password login where possible


=== SSH Session Opened ===
pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened indicates a successful login.
If login occurs from unusual IPs or at odd hours, verify user activity.

Recommended actions:
- audit login history
- enable multi-factor authentication
- review privileged account access


=== Vendor Transaction Events ===
VendorID and Code entries represent transaction processing events.
Repeated failure codes or anomalies may indicate payment failures or fraud attempts.

Recommended actions:
- monitor repeated failed codes
- verify transaction integrity
- alert fraud detection systems


=== Web Access Logs ===
HTTP GET/POST entries represent user browsing activity.
Unusual request spikes or repeated access to specific endpoints may indicate scraping or automated attacks.

Recommended actions:
- monitor request rate anomalies
- enable rate limiting
- block suspicious IP ranges
- implement WAF rules
